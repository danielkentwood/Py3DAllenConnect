# Py3DAllenConnect
A toolset for 3D interaction with Allen Institute connectivity dataset

This was a project I completed during the Summer Workshop on the Dynamic Brain with the Allen Institute. 

Essentially, it allows the user to choose neural tracing experiments from the [Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas] (http://connectivity.brain-map.org/) 
and visualize them in a 3D glass brain with an interface that allows rotation, zooming, etc. I won the prize for "Best Visualization."

I wrote this code 2 weeks after my first lesson in Python. :)
